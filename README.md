##Task2: Call Center Trends
Problem Statement: Create Power BI Dashboard for 'Call Center' to observe Customer’s and Agent’s Behaviors and their trends 
Source Data: EXCEL file 
Goals to be accomplished : Overall customer satisfaction -Overall calls answered/abandoned -Calls by time -Average speed of answer -Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
Key Insights:

⭐Overall customer satisfaction: This metric measures the percentage of customers who are satisfied with the service they received from the call center. It is calculated based on the responses of post-call surveys or other feedback mechanisms. 
⭐Overall calls answered/abandoned: This metric tracks the number of calls that were answered by agents versus the number of calls that were abandoned by customers before being connected to an agent. 
⭐Calls by time: This metric shows the distribution of calls over time, such as by hour, day, or week. This information can help identify patterns in call volume and adjust staffing levels accordingly. 
⭐Average speed of answer: This metric measures the average time it takes for an agent to answer a call. A low average speed of answer indicates that customers are quickly connected to agents, which can improve customer satisfaction. 
⭐Agent’s performance quadrant: This metric compares the average handle time (talk duration) of each agent with the number of calls they answered. Agents who have a low average handle time and a high number of calls answered are considered to be high-performing, while 
⭐agents who have a high average handle time and a low number of calls answered may require additional training or coaching.
⭐Overall, this dashboard provides a clear and concise view of the call center's performance, enabling management to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize operations.

##Task3: Customer Churn Retention
Problem Statement:Find out the Customers Churn and Service Churn and reasons ? 
This task aimed to uncover the reasons for customer churn, i.e., why customers were terminating their service. Through in-depth analysis and exploration of the dataset, I aimed to identify the key factors contributing to customer attrition. By gaining insights into these reasons, churn can be mitigated, and customer retention rates also be improved. 
Source Data: EXCEL file

Key Insights:
⭐26.58% of the customer database (1,869 individuals) has churned, leaving 5,163 remaining customers. 
⭐Recent churn of 380 customers emphasizes the need for proactive measures to improve retention strategies. 
⭐74.53% of churned customers belonged to the younger age group, highlighting the importance of addressing their specific needs.

⭐Customers using Electronic Checks experienced the highest churn rate 1,071, while Credit Card users had the lowest churn rate 232. 
⭐Average tenure for existing customers is approximately 38 months, compared to 18 months for churned customers. 
⭐Customers who churned had significantly higher average monthly charges of $74.44 compared to non-churned customers $61.31. 
⭐There is a monthly loss of $139.13K to the company due to customer churning.
